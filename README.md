# satelite_detection

#Description
The `satelite_detection` project focuses on identifying and analyzing satellite images. It leverages advanced technologies to detect objects and patterns in satellite imagery, which can be used for various applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management.

#Features
- Efficient satellite image processing.
- Object detection and pattern recognition.
- High accuracy with minimal computational overhead.
- Cross-platform support for Python-based environments.

#Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Navyasreenavi/satelite_detection.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the setup script if available:
   python setup.py install
   

#Usage
After installation, run the following command to process satellite images:

python detect.py --input /path/to/satellite/image.jpg --output /path/to/output.jpg


#Example

python detect.py --input samples/sample1.jpg --output results/result1.jpg


#Technologies Used
- CSS: For designing the front-end interface.
